# genesis-category

I am using an old custom page_archive.php to display the last 5 articles (and then a more >) of my categories, in place of the usual category page that also display pages and authors etc.

The old code is dropping the background on the newer version Agency Pro theme and making the page look awful.

Canâ€™t figure out if I need to completely redo, or if I just need to tweak page layout.
